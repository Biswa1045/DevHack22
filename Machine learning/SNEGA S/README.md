## Problem Statement:
<p> For criminological investigations, the glass piece left over can be useful. If we identify the type of glass, it can be used as evidence. </p>
 
## Dataset Information:
 - ID
 - Refractive Index
 - Sodium 
 - Magnesium
 - Aluminum
 - Silicon
 - Potassium
 - Calcium
 - Barium
 
## Solution:
 -  Initially I made exploratory data analysis in the dataset and got various insigths of the data. 
 -  There was no missing values in the data. Correlation of each feature were analyzed. 
 -  Splitting training and test dataset.
 -  Then I used various Machine Learning Algorithms to classify the type of glasses and fitting the model into the data.
 ## Algorithms Used:
  - Random Forest
  - Decision Trees
  - Naive Bayes
  - K Nearest Neighbors
  
  <p> The accuracy of all the algorithms were compared </p>
  - Random Forest - 100%
  - Naive Bayes - 76%
  - Decision Trees - 98%
  - KNN - 96%
  
  <p> Upon all algorithms Random Forest and Decision Tree gave almost 100% accuracy. It may change between 98%-100% on cross validation <p>
